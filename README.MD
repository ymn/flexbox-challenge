Game features:

- The game area should be centered to the screen (using Flexbox)
- The size of the boxes should adjust when the window size changes (using Flexbox) ([Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxrJB10kuj4))
- It should display 3 boxes per row (using Flexbox)
- A box should disappear when its clicked, and the game area should adjust itself ([Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxrJB10kuj4)) (using Flexbox and Javascript)
- Ability to reset the game via a reset button. (Javascript)
